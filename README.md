# North Pacific Ocean Tropical Depressions Novel Forecast Model

## Abstract

Building upon the [foundational analysis of the effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on tropical depressions (TDs) in the North Pacific Ocean](https://github.com/StanDobrev11/enso_effect_on_npacific_tds), 
this current project takes the research a step further by developing a machine learning (ML) forecast model. The aim is to predict the track, intensity, 
and progression of tropical depressions based on their initial characteristics and ENSO phases.

In the previous project, correlations between ENSO phases and various tropical depression characteristics, such as frequency, intensity, and storm tracks were successfully identified, 
especially in the NE Pacific region. It was established that El Niño and La Niña events have discernible impacts on where and how frequently TDs form, 
as well as their overall intensity across the North Pacific region. This prior work provided valuable insights into how different ENSO conditions influence tropical depressions, 
laying a strong foundation for more advanced predictive modeling.
